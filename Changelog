Major changes list:

1. Added Repository layer for logic related to accessing physical storage (as requested).
2. Changed approach: to generate a class and to use SpecificDatumReader instead of GenericDatumReader (as requested).
3. Enlarged the schema with more fields of different types (optional task).
   Was added:
     - Non-optional fields: active(type: boolean), Gender(type: enum), last_purchases(type: array);
     - Optional fields: age(type: int), total_purchase_amount(type: double).
   There is a sample in resources folder.
4. Added some unit/integration tests.
